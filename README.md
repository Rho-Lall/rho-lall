## Hi there 👋 I'm rho,

I'm a bulldozer. I help executives with AI strategy to cut through the noise, amplify leadership, and bring down ruthless clarity on complex problems.

# Is AI Coming to Replace You?
##### No. But someone who uses AI is.

Still buried in a silo of spreadsheets? While others scale AI, you can’t agree on the numbers. Don’t just plug in AI. Use it to plug the gaps between your people.

You pushed AI to make faster calls.  
But the real problem isn’t speed. It's alignment.  
You can’t automate decisions when no one agrees on the data.

Companies don’t fail at AI because the tools are broken. They fail because their people are unaligned. The same team that argues over data in spreadsheets won’t magically start collaborating because you handed them a shiny new model. You can’t automate what isn’t agreed upon.

But what if instead of waiting years for the culture to “get ready,” you used AI to align it — fast?

If you suspect your culture isn't ready to embrace AI, instead of looking to empower your business with AI, empower your culture.








I help leaders work on their business instead of getting buried in their business.
Whether it's dirty data, stalled goals, or tangled execution: I build systems that get to the right decisions and put them on autopilot.

The result?

Teams that work cleaner, think clearer, and lead with confidence.
Because to grab growth, sometimes you have to let go of the grind.

Do you want to bulldoze thru the BS? Let's talk.
